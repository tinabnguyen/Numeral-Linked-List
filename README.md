# Numeral-Linked-List
This C++ program enhances the Roman Numeral Converter program by implementing the use of linked lists. Given a file of Roman and Arabic numerals, the program will read in and convert the numerals. Then, the user can decide to search for a numeral or sort the list of numerals by Roman or Arabic.
